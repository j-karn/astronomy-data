This repository captures the assignments I did as part of the 6-week Data Driven Astronomy course using Python + SQL offered on Coursera by the University of Sydney.<br>
</br>
  <b>Week 1: Understanding and detecting Pulsars</b></br>
  <b>Task:</b> As pulsars give off very faint signals, astronomers use image stacking technique in order to detect the underlying signals. To do so, they find the mean brightness at each pixel of the images. This approach averages out the noise and enhances a bright spot revealing the potential pulsars.
  <br>
    <li>Uploading, opening, and cleaning csv and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FITS">FITS</a> files</li>
    <li>Working with lists and arrays
    <li>Writing a function to calculate the mean of a set of potential pulsar signals</li>
    <b>Libraries</b> - pandas, numpy, astropy.io, matplotlib
<br></br>
  <b>Week 2: Cross matching between different astronomical catalogues</b></br>
   <b>Task:</b> When studying galaxies, it is crucial to review different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum to comprehensively understand the structure and composition of the galaxies. This means astronomers compare data about those objects from different telescopes at different wavelengths. This requires positional cross-matching to find the closest counterpart within a given radius on the sky.
  <br></br>
    <li>Cross-matching between a radio survey catalogue (BSS) and an optical survey (SuperCOSMOS)</li>
    <li>Importing and working with csv and dat files</li>
    <li>Converting celestial coordinates to decimal degrees/ radian and calculating the angular difference between the objects</li>
    <li>Writing a function to cross match between the two catalogues and output the objects that are within predefined maximum distance</li>
    <b>Libraries</b> - requests, numpy

  <b>Week 3: Querying data using SQL to answer questions around Exoplanets</b></br>
   <b>Task:</b> sa;ifjaosijf
